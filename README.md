# Hands-on-PC-Maintanence 📸

Date: 30 October 2025

We had a hands-on PC maintenance session where I learnt how to properly handle the components while assembling and reassembling the PC case.

I  learnt to identify the main components and their functions
-SATA cable : Connects storage to motherboard.
-Power supply : Powers all components.
-RAM (2GB) : Temporary memory for running programs.
-Hard disc (250GB) : Stores data and OS.
-Cooling fan : Keeps components cool.

This session gave me the confidence to work with PC hardware and understand its functionality better. 
Some of the pictures are from my group mate.
